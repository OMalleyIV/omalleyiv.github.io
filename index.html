<P>The Braves will certainly have payroll flexibility after the conclusion of the 2018 season. 
With the contracts of players like Brandon McCarthy, Nick Markakis, Scott Kazmir, Adrian Gonzalez
coming off othe books, the Braves could have up to $50 million to spend if they so choose. While it 
would be easy to go after one of the <a href="http://www.spotrac.com/mlb/free-agents/2019/"> marquee free agents </a> 
like Bryce Harper or Manny Machado, the Braves
would be better suited spending smart on a few pieces rather than just one. The Braves are still young 
and could be a season or two from seriously competing. With this being the case, there are lots of holes
throught the roster. With Markakis most likely leaving after the season, they will have to fill one outfield
position, third base remains unoccupied in the longterm, both catchers will be free agents, and there are 
numerous spots in the pitching staff that could be upgraded.
<br>With this being the case, here is what the 
Braves should do.</P>
<P>The Braves should avoid contracts longer than <B>four or five years</B>, which rules out many of the bigger 
free agents. This allows the Braves flexibility to re-sign their younger players down the road. Some players
that would be good a good fit for the Braves are:</P>
	<div style="text-align:center"><ul style="list-style-type:disc">
	<li>SP - Garrett Richards (Los Angeles Angels)</li>
	<li>SP - Patrick Corban (Arizona Diamondbacks)</li>
	<li>RP - Justin Wilson (Chicago Cubs)</li>
	<li>3B - Josh Donaldson (Toronto Blue Jays)</li>
	<li>OF - A.J. Pollack (Arizona Diamondbacks)</li>
	</ul></div>
<P>These pitchers are younger than most on the free agent market but have had their share of issues, whether
 it be injury issues, or inconsistency. This could allow the Braves to buy low on these players in a low risk, 
 high reward type deal. A.J. Pollack is similar in that way. Josh Donaldson is where things get tricky. He is
 the oldest player on the list at 32 as well as the best player on the list as a former MVP winner. He will 
 not come cheap but that's okay if the Braves offer him a shorter contract. He could be a middle of the
 order bat to protect Freddie Freeman and a mentor to one of the youngest teams in baseball. Below is a table
 with what it would take to sign the above players.</P>
